<pre class='wrap'>== OpenDataPlane (1.23.0.0)
=== Summary of Changes
The ODP API changes in this release are related to the classifier module.

The implementation changes include bug fixes (classifier, socket pktio),
configurability improvements (inline timer), new packet segmentation
implementation, and performance improvements (pool).

=== API
==== Classifier
The PMR term documentation was not explicit about endianness of value and mask
fields. Most terms assumed CPU endian, but terms with larger data sizes assumed
big endian (MAC, IPv6 address and custom).

Term specification was harmonized so that all terms expect value/mask data to be
in big-endian format, have fixed size, and allow free memory alignment. Packet
length term is an exception to this as it does not represent a field in a
packet.

Added new `ODP_PMR_CUSTOM_L3` term to match custom layer 3 protocol fields. PMR
offset refers to the start of layer 3 in the packet. Other PMR rules (e.g. L2
classification rules) may precede custom L3 rules.

=== Helper
Duplicate `ODPH_UNUSED` macro has been removed. `ODP_UNUSED` should be used
instead.

=== Validation Tests
==== Common
Improved test result output when some tests are inactive (skipped due to missing
capability). Now inactive tests are listed by default in the test suite results.

==== Classifier
Cleaned up validation test code. Classifier implementation missed reporting some
capabilities, tests didn't check those capabilities and they were tested. Source
IPv4 term test was missing.

Added serial PMR test, which tests series of PMR and CoS:

* From default CoS to dest IPv4 CoS
* From dest IPv4 CoS to dest UDP CoS

Added parallel PMR test, which test serial and parallel PMR and CoS:

* From default CoS to dest IPv4 CoS
* From dest IPv4 CoS to a parallel UDP CoS per destination port number

==== Scheduler
Added new validation tests to verify that packet order is maintained when events
are enqueued and dequeued to/from a plain queue while maintaining atomic/ordered
scheduling context.

==== Timer
Added private timer pool test, which creates a timer pool with the `priv` flag
set. The same thread calls schedule / queue_deq that created the pool.

=== Example Applications
==== timer_perf
Added new test application to measure schedule call CPU cycle consumption with
various timer pool parameter combinations. This measurement is mostly
interesting with software-based timer implementations, where timers may be
polled from the schedule call.

==== New odp_ping application
This application replies to IPv4 ping requests. It can be used to test
connectivity with standard ping utility. ARP table needs to be setup manually on
the sender side as the application does not reply to ARP requests.

==== odp_classifier
Added source CoS name into the parameter list of `-p` option. This enables
linking classification rules together. When a source CoS is not defined, the
default CoS is used as the source CoS.

Option `-p` parameter list format is now:

    &lt;term&gt;:&lt;xxx&gt;:&lt;yyy&gt;:&lt;src_cos&gt;:&lt;dst_cos&gt;

Where `&lt;src_cos&gt;` is optional and number of "xxx", "yyy", etc. parameters is
term depend.

Added `-v` option which prints received packet with CoS queue
name. This can be used for debugging classification rules.

Added support for `ODP_PMR_VLAN_ID_0`, `ODP_PMR_ETHTYPE_0`, `ODP_PMR_CUSTOM_L3`,
`ODP_PMR_ETHTYPE_X`, `ODP_PMR_VLAN_ID_X`, `ODP_PMR_UDP_DPORT`,
`ODP_PMR_UDP_SPORT`, `ODP_PMR_TCP_DPORT`, and `ODP_PMR_TCP_SPORT` rules.

==== timer_accuracy
Fix bug in timer start offset calculation. Test results were offset by current
local time value.

Added delay and extra schedule calls to ensure that (software) timer
implementation has passed its initial state before setting up timers.

Added `-f` option to control offset to the first timer. This can be used e.g. to
avoid best/worst case synchronization of timers to timer tick boundaries /
resolution.

==== packet_dump
Added ICMP support. Print ICMP offset and ICMPv4 type/code. This helps to verify
that ping requests are received.

==== bench_packet
Added missing tests for the following packet functions:

* `odp_packet_data_seg_len()`
* `odp_packet_free_sp()`
* `odp_packet_from_event_multi()`
* `odp_packet_to_event_multi()`
* `odp_packet_subtype()`
* `odp_packet_parse()`
* `odp_packet_parse_multi()`

=== Implementation
==== Classifier
Cleaned up implementation. Fixed endianness.

==== Inline Timer
Cleaned up code. Fixed accuracy issue with high resolution (&lt;100us) timer pools.
Added configuration option `inline_poll_interval_nsec` to select default poll
interval in nsec.

Added configure file option for inline timer (`inline_thread_type`) to select if
control threads poll shared timer pools or not. Control threads still poll their
private pools. With this user can configure control and worker threads to use
separate timer pools.

==== Packet I/O
Enable explicit pktio type definition. The pktio type is selected by adding
pktio_type prefix in front of device name separated by a colon
(&lt;pktio_type&gt;:&lt;if_name&gt;).

The socket mmsg pktio implementation has been refactored and performance has
been improved.

The IPC pktio implementation has been modified to use standard ODP internal
`ring_ptr_t` rings to implement IPC rings. This enables removing the duplicate
`_ring_t` implementation.

==== Pool
Packet segmentation has been reimplemented using a linked list. The new
implementation is simpler and has the added benefit of greatly reducing
packet and buffer header sizes.

=== Bug Fixes
==== Unnumbered Bugs / Issues
* Fixed socket mmap pktio throughput collapse under heavy traffic

* Fixed missing config header in install directory

* Include only ODP defines in autogenerated header files

* Fixed GCC 9 `address-of-packed-member` warnings

* Disable building static test applications without static ODP lib

* Fixed a segfault in `odp_pktin_recv_mq_tmo()` implementation

* Fixed classifier vlan match bugs and tests

* Fixed classifier matching of parallel PMRs


== OpenDataPlane (1.22.0.0)
=== Summary of Changes
ODP v1.22.0.0 adds several smaller API changes mainly related to API
clarification.

=== API Changes
==== Added `odp_queue_order_t` parameter to `odp_queue_param_t`
Added a parameter to control if a destination queue does not require event
re-ordering. By default, event order is maintained for all destination queues as
before. Application may use `ODP_QUEUE_ORDER_IGNORE` for those queues that are
used under ordered queue context, but do not require re-ordering and/or do need
to avoid extra re-ordering delays.

==== Added `ODP_SHM_HP` flag for `odp_shm_reserve()`
When set, this flag guarantees that the memory reserved by `odp_shm_reserve()`
is allocated from huge pages. If enough huge page memory is not available the
call will fail.

==== Improved initialization and termination specification
Improve specification of initialization and termination steps. Explicitly list
those functions that may be used before global init (those that are needed for
setting up parameters). No changes to functionality.

==== Improved queue context specification
Highlight that queue context default value is NULL. This was defined already in
`odp_queue_param_t` specification.

==== New Crypto Algorithm Support
Support for new crypto algorithms is added by defining symbols for:

* `ODP_CIPHER_ALG_3DES_ECB`
* `ODP_CIPHER_ALG_AES_ECB`
* `ODP_CIPHER_ALG_AES_CFB128`
* `ODP_CIPHER_ALG_AES_XTS`
* `ODP_CIPHER_ALG_AES_EEA2`

Support for new crypto authentication algorithms is added by defining symbols
for:

* `ODP_AUTH_ALG_SHA224_HMAC`
* `ODP_AUTH_ALG_AES_EIA2`

Added enumeration for digest (unkeyed) algorithms. They are added as auth
algorithms with empty key required.

* `ODP_AUTH_ALG_MD5`
* `ODP_AUTH_ALG_SHA1`
* `ODP_AUTH_ALG_SHA224`
* `ODP_AUTH_ALG_SHA256`
* `ODP_AUTH_ALG_SHA384`
* `ODP_AUTH_ALG_SHA512`

==== Crypto specification improvements / fixes
Correct documentation for `ODP_AUTH_ALG_SNOW3G_UIA2` to reference 128-EIA1
instead of 128-EEA1.

Clarify IV data format and point to proper documents for 3GPP algorithms.

==== Timer specification clarification
Timer API intention has always been to allow any event type to be used as
timeout events. Application should use `ODP_EVENT_TIMEOUT` type events
(`odp_timeout_t`) by default, but also other event types may be used. Also,
clarified timer set/reset functionality of `odp_timer_set_abs()` and
`odp_timer_set_rel()` functions.

API functionality not changed, just wording updated.

==== Added timer resolution capability
Typically, timer implementation needs to trade-off between highest resolution
and longest timeout. Add new capability information
(`odp_timer_res_capability_t`) and function to check limits between resolution
and maximum timeout length.

`odp_timer_res_capability()`::
This function fills in capability limits for timer pool resolution and min/max
timeout values, based on either resolution or maximum timeout.

==== Added defines for minute and hour
Defines for a minute and an hour are useful e.g. when setting timers for a bit
longer (background, session lifetime, etc.) timeouts.

* `ODP_TIME_MIN_IN_NS`
* `ODP_TIME_HOUR_IN_NS`

=== Helper Changes
==== Added helper library version
Added helper library version defines, so that application can track helper
version independent of ODP API version:

* `ODPH_VERSION_GENERATION`
* `ODPH_VERSION_MAJOR`
* `ODPH_VERSION_MINOR`

Also, added a function for generating easy printout of the versions number.

`odph_version_str()`::
The version string defines the helper library version the following format:
 `&lt;generation&gt;.&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;`

==== Added new thread create and join functions
Defined new versions of thread create and join calls. The new calls explicitly
support thread create and join in multiple steps. Also, per thread
(`odph_thread_param_t`) and common parameters (`odph_thread_common_param_t`)
have been improved.

`odph_thread_create()`::
Create and pin threads (as Linux pthreads or processes)

`odph_thread_join()`::
Wait previously launched threads to exit

Old functions `odph_odpthreads_create()` and `odph_odpthreads_join()`
have been deprecated.

==== Added helper debug defines
Added debug defines/macros into helper API and configure options to
enable/disable helper debugging. These defines may be used both in helper and
application code:

* `ODPH_DEBUG` is 1 when helper debugging is enabled (`--enable-helper-debug`)
* `ODPH_DEBUG_PRINT` is 1 when helper debug printing is enabled (`--enable-helper-debug-print`)
* `ODPH_ASSERT()` generates assertion code when helper debugging is enabled

=== Validation Test Improvements
==== Timer Test Improvements
Enables passing tests on high core count devices.

Test min/max timeouts with the highest resolution and longest timeout
parameters.

==== Scheduler Test Fixes
The group test would fail if `odp_schedule(ODP_SCHED_NO_WAIT)` wouldn't return
any events on the first call.

`scheduler_test_pause_resume()` would get stuck if all events were not
successfully enqueued.

Fixed a number of synchronization problems revealed by a scheduler
implementation doing pre-scheduling. Makes sure scheduling context is always
properly released.

==== Classification Test Fixes
Some of the test array elements may have not been set if the number of supported
scheduling priorities was low.

==== Pktio Test Improvements
Added more debug information on magic number misses.

==== Initialization Test Improvements / Fixes
Added missing local init/term calls to all test cases.

Added test case to set num_worker and num_control parameters.

Added test case to set not used features flags in init parameters.

==== Buffer Test Fixes
Test suite missed to output the return value of `odp_cunit_run()`.

==== Queue Test Improvements
Check that queue context pointer value is NULL by default.

==== IPsec Test Fixes
Check pktio level inline IPsec support before running tests.

==== Crypto Test Improvements
Added support for AES-194-GMAC and AES-256-GMAC algorithms.

Added more AES-CBC and AES-CTR test vectors.

=== Example Changes
==== Added new pipeline example application
The application receives packets from one interface and passes them through 0-N
worker stages before outputting them from a second network interface. The RX,
worker, and TX stages are connected using plain queues and each stage is run on
a separate CPU thread. Optionally, the worker stages calculate CRC-32C over
packet data.

==== Time example fixes
Fix single worker deadlock and run the application as part of `make check`.

==== IPsec example fixes
Fixed a number of issues in IPsec example applications and run them during
`make check`.

==== New command line options
===== l2fwd
* added `-b` option to control maximum packet receive burst size

===== pool_perf
* added `-n` option to allocate multiple event bursts before freeing those
* added `-t` option to select between buffer or packet pool types
* added `-s` option to select data size

===== sched_perf

* added `-w` option to simulate application work
* added `-g` and `-j` options to test scheduling with a number of schedule groups

=== Implementation Improvements
==== Pool Implementation Improvements
Refactor local buffer caching into separate functions and optimize
implementation by caching buffer header pointers instead of indices.

New configuration options have been added for local cache
(`pool:local_cache_size`) and burst sizes (`pool:burst_size`).

Pool implementation has been modified to store buffer headers instead of
indices to reduce type conversion overhead.

==== Timer Implementation Improvements
Added warm up period into POSIX timer pool startup to avoid the first timeout
to slip. Otherwise, timer pthread receives the first signal after about 15ms and
first timeout of the pool slips.

==== DPDK Packet I/O Improvements
The zero-copy DPDK pktio implementation has been cleaned up resulting a small
performance improvement. Linking to DPDK library has also been simplified.

=== Miscellaneous
* ODP project has been moved from Linaro to OpenFastPath Foundation. Project
documentation and domain addresses have been updated to reflect this change.

* Added `--without-pcap` configuration option to explicitly build ODP without
PCAP pktio regardless of if the library is available on the build host.

* Added `--enable-lto` configuration option to build ODP with link time
optimization (`-flto` flag).

* Travis default distribution is updated to Ubuntu Xenial.

* Added `-O3`, `-O0`, and LTO build tests to Travis

* Supported Netmap version has been bumped to v13.0

== OpenDataPlane (1.21.0.0)
=== Summary of Changes
ODP v1.21.0.0 adds two new API families as well as several small improvements.

==== APIs
===== Compression Support
A new family of APIs is added that provides for session-oriented support for
packet data compression and decompression. Compression sessions define the
parameters used to control compression operations and their associated
integrity hashes.  Once created, sessions are input parameters to the new
`odp_comp_op()` and `odp_comp_op_enq()` APIs that provide access to
synchronous and asynchronous compression services on packets.

Associated with the completion of asynchronous compression operations, a new
packet subtype, `ODP_EVENT_PACKET_COMP` is defined. This subtype indicates
that the packet includes additional metadata (retrievable via
`odp_comp_result()`) that provides the result of the requested operation.

A number of different compression and associated hash algorithms are defined,
which are communicated with three new capability APIs:

`odp_comp_capability()`::
Provides information about general compression related capabilities
offered by this implementation

`odp_comp_alg_capability()`::
Provides details about the capabilities of individual compression algorithms
supported.

`odp_comp_hash_alg_capability()`::
Provides details about the capabilities of individual hash algorithms
supported for use with compression.

===== Flow Aware Scheduler Support
A new capability for flow aware scheduling is added. As part of this, the
scheduler now supports capabilities and configurability. As a result, the
initialization sequence for applications that make use of the ODP scheduler
has changed slightly. The new API call sequence is:
[source,c]
-----
odp_schedule_capability()
odp_schedule_config_init()
odp_schedule_config()
odp_schedule()
-----
It is a programming error to call `odp_schedule()` (or its variants) without
having first initialized the scheduler with an `odp_schedule_config()` call.
This call may only be issued once per ODP instance as scheduler configuration
is global.

By default the scheduler operates as before. When configured to operate in
flow aware mode, the scheduler will now respect event flow ids (managed by the
new `odp_event_flow_id()` and `odp_event_flow_id_set()` APIs) when making
scheduling decisions. This means that flow identification is a combination of
event flow id and queue id. For example, when operating in flow aware mode the
scheduler may dispatch events from an atomic queue to multiple threads
concurrently, as long as those events have different flow ids. For
applications that process large numbers of lightweight flows that have limited
context needs, this can lead to throughput improvements as well as reduced
implementation memory footprint.

==== DPDK v18.11 Support
The latest LTS release of DPDK (v18.11) is now supported by ODP. Support for
the previous LTS release (v17.11) is retained. Prior versions of DPDK are
no longer supported.

==== Queue Capabilities Moved to Scheduler
As part of the introduction of flow-aware scheduling, capabilities associated
with `SCHED` queues have been moved from the `odp_queue_capabilities_t` struct
returned by `odp_queue_capabilities()` to the new `odp_sched_capabilities_t`
struct returned by `odp_sched_capabilities()`.

Capabilities moved include `max_ordered_locks`, `max_sched_groups`, and
`sched_prios`. The `max_sched_groups` capability is renamed `max_groups`. In
addition, `max_queues`, `max_queue_size`, and the support capabilities for
lock free and wait free non blocking queues is now part of the scheduler
capabilities.

In support of flow aware scheduling mode, the `max_flows` scheduler capability
is renamed `max_flow_id`. A value of 0 indicates that flow aware mode
scheduling is not available in this ODP implementation.

=== Test/Validation Improvements
==== Travis readability improvement
The "BUILD_ONLY` environment variable has been renamed `CHECK` for improved
output readability.

==== Flow aware scheduler testing
As part of flow aware mode, scheduler validation tests will now test this mode
if `odp_schedule_capability()` indicates that flow-aware mode is supported.

=== Bug Fixes
==== Unnumbered Bugs/Issues

* Latest version of netmap `nm_ring_empty()` implementation has changed.
PktIO netmap support updated to support this as well as previous releases.

* Improved compatibility of PktIO socket support with latest versions
of the clang compiler.

* Add match pattern for missing DPDK PMD drivers for improved compatibility.

== OpenDataPlane (1.20.0.0)
=== Summary of Changes
ODP v1.20.0.0 is a refresh of ODP, incorporating significant configurability
and performance improvements as well as new APIs and API restructures.

==== APIs
===== Symbol `ODP_SHM_NULL` Removed.
An invalid `odp_shm_t` has the value `ODP_SHM_INVALID`, consistent with other
ODP types. The legacy synonym `ODP_SHM_NULL` is now removed for consistency.

===== New 3GPP Crypto Algorithm Support
New support for 3GPP crypto algorithms is added by defining symbols for

* `ODP_CIPHER_ALG_KASUMI_F8`
* `ODP_CIPHER_ALG_SNOW3G_UEA2`
* `ODP_CIPHER_ALG_ZUC_EEA3`

In addition new authentication algorithm symbols are defined for

* `ODP_AUTH_ALG_KASUMI_F9`
* `ODP_AUTH_ALG_SNOW3G_UIA2`
* `ODP_AUTH_ALG_ZUC_EIA3`

These values are returned as ODP capabilities as well as being accepted in
crypto session creation for implementations that indicate support for them.

===== Crypto Capability for Bitwise Operation
The new `bit_mode` capability Boolean is added to the
`odp_crypto_cipher_capability_t` struct to indicate that an implementation
supports operating in bit mode. When operating in bit
mode, field offsets and lengths are expressed in terms of bits rather than
bytes. However, such lengths must always be specified in multiples of 8.

===== Improved Crypto Spec Documentation
The ODP crypto API specification is tightened to specify default values for
cipher and authentication algorithms. Also documented when key and IV
parameters need to be set.

===== IPsec Extensions
IPsec requires "salt" (extra keying material) when the GMAC authentication
algorithm is used. To accommodate this the `auth_key_extra` field is added to
the `odp_ipsec_crypto_param_t` struct and documentation is added clarifying
when this field is needed and how it should be used.

===== Classifier Type Rename
The `odp_pmr_t` type name for an invalid value is renamed from `ODP_PMR_INVAL`
to `ODP_PMR_INVALID` for consistency with the rest of ODP type names. The old
symbol is still available when ODP is configured with
`--enable-deprecated`.

===== New API for Packet Event Subtypes
The `odp_packet_subtype()` API is added that returns the subtype of a packet
event directly.

===== Streamlined Packet Parsing Results
The `odp_packet_parse_result()` API is added that returns the result of
packet parsing as a single `odp_packet_parse_result_t` struct. This can
offer efficiency improvements for applications that need all parse results
rather than making individual parse result calls.

===== PktIO Extensions to Support per-Queue Configuration
PktIO interfaces support multiple input queues to enable increased parallelism
in I/O processing. Previously, all of these input queues were required to
belong to the same scheduler group. The `odp_pktin_queue_param_t` struct is
now extended with an optional `odp_pktin_queue_param_ovr_t` struct that
permits individual pktin queues to be assigned to separate scheduler groups.
This may permit improved performance for advanced application use cases.

===== Timer Pool Capabilities
The `odp_timer_capability_t` struct is extended to return three additional
pieces of information:

`max_pools_combined`::
The total number of timer pools that can be created combining different
clock sources

`max_pools`::
The maximum number of timer pools for a given clock source.

`max_timers`::
The maximum number of timers in a single pool. A zero value means number is
limited only by available memory.

===== Add Scheduler mix/max/default Priority Functions
Three new APIs: `odp_schedule_max_prio()`, `odp_schedule_min_prio()`, and
`odp_schedule_default_prio()` are added that return the min, max, and default
values specified for the `prio` field in the `odp_schedule_param_t` struct.

With the introduction of these scheduling priority functions the previously
defined macros (`ODP_SCHED_PRIO_HIGHEST`, `ODP_SCHED_PRIO_NORMAL`, and
`ODP_SCHED_PRIO_LOWEST`) are now deprecated and should no longer be used.

===== Specification of `odp_schedule_prio_t` as an `int`
Previously, the `odp_schedule_prio_t` type definition was left to each
implementation. With the addition of explicit schedule priority ranges, this
type is now specified to be an `int` to permit efficient implementation
(including inlining) of these functions.

====== New Scheduler APIs
The new scheduler APIs `odp_schedule_multi_wait()` and
`odp_schedule_multi_no_wait()` are added to provide more efficiently
implementable versions of these functions. The existing scheduler APIs remain
unchanged. These new APIs can simply provide a fastpath for some
applications/implementations as an alternative to specifying a parameter on
`odp_schedule_multi()`.

===== Memory Model in `odp_init_global()`
The `odp_init_t` parameter passed to `odp_init_global()` is extended to
add the `mem_model` field. This field is defined by the new `odp_mem_model_t`
struct and is used to specify whether the application will be using a
thread (`ODP_MEM_MODEL_THREAD`) or process (`ODP_MEM_MODEL_PROCESS`)
memory model. The default is a thread model is used for compatibility with
previous levels of ODP.

==== ABI Changes
A number of changes to the ODP ABI have also been made in this release to
improve application binary portability.

===== Strong Typing for Timer Pools
The `odp_timer_pool_t` is now strongly typed.

===== Consistent
